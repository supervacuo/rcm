rcm
===

This is a management suite for dotfiles. **See [the tutorial][rcm7] to get
started quickly.**

It assumes that you have a separate dotfiles directory, or are
interested in creating one.

The programs provided are [rcup(1)][rcup1], [mkrc(1)][mkrc1], [rcdn(1)][rcdn1],
and [lsrc(1)][lsrc1]. They are explained in [the tutorial][rcm7] and configured
using [rcrc(5)][rcrc5].

Installation
------------

Arch Linux:

  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rcm/

Debian-based:

    wget -qO - https://apt.thoughtbot.com/thoughtbot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb http://apt.thoughtbot.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/thoughtbot.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install rcm

Fedora 22-28:

    sudo dnf copr enable seeitcoming/rcm
    sudo dnf install rcm
    
Korora:

  64-bit Korora 23:

    sudo dnf copr enable seeitcoming/rcm fedora-23-x86_64
    sudo dnf install rcm

  Korora is similar to Fedora but with [an additional version and architecture
  specification][copr-fedora-korora]. Replace `fedora-23-x86_64` as
  appropriate.

OpenBSD (-current):

    doas pkg_add rcm

FreeBSD:

    sudo pkg install rcm

openSUSE/RHEL/CentOS: [instructions](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=utilities&package=rcm)

macOS with Homebrew:

    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
    brew install rcm

macOS with MacPorts:

    port install rcm

Ubuntu:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:martin-frost/thoughtbot-rcm
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install rcm

Gentoo:

    emerge app-admin/rcm

Elsewhere:

This uses the standard GNU autotools, so it's the normal dance:

    curl -LO https://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/dist/rcm-1.3.1.tar.gz && \

    sha=$(sha256 rcm-1.3.1.tar.gz | cut -f1 -d' ') && \
    [ "$sha" = "9c8f92dba63ab9cb8a6b3d0ccf7ed8edf3f0fb388b044584d74778145fae7f8f" ] && \

    tar -xvf rcm-1.3.1.tar.gz && \
    cd rcm-1.3.1 && \

    ./configure && \
    make && \
    sudo make install

For more, see `INSTALL`.

Programs
--------

* [rcup(1)][rcup1] is the main program. It is used to install and update
  dotfiles, with support for tags, host-specific files, and multiple source
  directories.
* [rcdn(1)][rcdn1] is the opposite of [rcup(1)][rcup1].
* [mkrc(1)][mkrc1] is for introducing a dotfile into your dotfiles directory,
  with support for tags and multiple source directories.
* [lsrc(1)][lsrc1] shows you all your dotfiles and where they would be
  symlinked to. It is used by [rcup(1)][rcup1] but is provided for your own
  use, too.
